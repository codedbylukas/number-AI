# Simple AI Training Tool

This project is a minimal interactive Python program that demonstrates **machine learning** using **linear regression** from `scikit-learn`.  
It allows users to input their own data points, train a simple model, and generate predictions — all directly from the terminal.

---

## Features
- Interactive data entry for training
- Basic linear regression model using `sklearn`
- Instant prediction based on user input
- Educational and beginner-friendly structure

---

## Requirements
Before running the script, make sure you have Python and `scikit-learn` installed.

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

## How It Works
### 1. Start the program

Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
## Example Use Case

If you enter points that roughly follow a line (like 1→2, 2→4, 3→6),
the program will learn the relationship and predict future Y values for new X inputs.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x

- scikit-learn

- Linear Regression (Supervised Learning)

## Notes

This script is designed for educational purposes.

It’s a simple example to understand how regression models work.

For real projects, consider data validation, scaling, and persistence.
